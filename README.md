## Context

You are interning for a game development company.

After your great work on [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/WeAreAcademy/mark-oop-proj--tic-tac-toe) and [Connect Four](https://github.com/WeAreAcademy/mark-oop-proj--tic-tac-toe), you have been given an opportunity to pitch and build a game of your choosing - an opportunity reserved for star interns of the past before!

Previous star interns have pitched and built games of:
- Mastermind
- Hangman
- Blackjack

(These files were all lost in a sad accident, so this shouldn't stop you from trying your hand at one of those specific examples.)

## Exercise 1: Plan the idea

What's your plan? How should the game work? Well, it's up to you.

However, you should probably scope it out before you spend loads of time implementing, so your first job is to:

- Prepare a specification for the game
  - What goes in your first version? (Think ['minimum viable product'](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mvp))
  - What goes in further versions?
- Estimate how long it will take you to complete the first version

Possible artefacts of this are:
- A markdown file describing the project
- Some written tests which capture the specification
- A list of sub-tasks which collectively compose the whole project

## Exercise 2: Build the project

Now, you get to try to enact your plan.

Keep a track of how long it's taking you compared to what you expected.

## Exercise 3: Plan a presentation

To mark the end of your internship, you have been asked to deliver a presentation on this project.

You have a time guidance of ~5 minutes, with the expectation that this includes:
- A short demo of the result
- A quick tour through the codebase
- An explanation of your working and lessons learned

You have been asked to record yourself making this presentation (for posterity!), e.g. using a tool like [Screenity](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/screenity).

## Exercise 4: Reflect on the process

For the Tic Tac Toe project, you were amending some existing code.

For the Connect Four project, you had to following an existing specification (but then write most of the code from scratch yourself).

For this project, you have designed the specification yourself.

How does this last experience compare to the other two? What are the challenges associated with it?
